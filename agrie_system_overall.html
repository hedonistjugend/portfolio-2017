            <h1>Aggregion & Material Design</h1>

            <article class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                <p>When I joined Aggregion application was already working. The design was applied by the dev team and looked a bit rough.
                    The team has already made a solution to use Material Design framework based on Angular.
                    Bootstrap's default theme was already to boring, so devs thought, that material will work quite fine.
                    Before joining the Agreggion I haven't heard about any enterprise systems that use Material.
                    Truth be told even Google doesn't use Material in all of it's apps except on phones & tablets.
                    So I had some doubts about it. Here I tell how we overcome some moments and finally got what we have now.

                <h3>Floating Labels</h3>
                <p>
                    Before I used floating labels I always thought it is a nice idea.
                    You don't have to think about placeholders' text because labels are already placeholders.
                    And then they don't disappear which is a very common ux flaw. But there is a twist with floating labels.
                    Paddings for filled fields and empty fields are different, and some fields are quite often empty.
                    So you have to find the golden standart of padding,
                    so the field don't appear to close or to far way and keep nice vertical rhythm.

                <h3>FAB-buttons</h3>
                <p>
                    My general idea when the designing apps is quite simple – screen (big or small) should have main goal.
                    The task we want to complete. Material design also has this idea and uses FAB-button.
                    The button is big, floats with the screen and is close to the thumb (on phones).
                    But it has a serious flaw. It has no text and icon without text (Nielsen approves)
                    is a first step in direction of user frustration.
                    Users generally tend to avoid unknown, so they don't push the button. But it is the main button of the screen.
                <p>
                    You can disagree that users still know some icons for example Save & Add.
                    But what if we have some Save & Confirm or Save & Add Files. So we needed text on the button.
                    But what comes next will shock you – in enterprise apps there are usually alternate user flows that
                    also need actions but no so prominent.
                    So we came with idea of FAB-panels consisting of main button and some alternate buttons that look not so shiny.
                    Let's place it on bottom of the screen and make always visible.
