                <p> My name is Kostya Dmitriev and I'm a product designer with focus on web apps.
                    I'm making some designy stuff since 2011. You can read about my working experience
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantin-dmitriev-89a11b58/?locale=en_US">on&#160;Linkedin</a>.
                    I love working on products and trying to make them easier to understand and use.
                     Unfortunately sometimes it doesn't work out at first but I'm always working on it. üòÖ
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a bit systematic so I admire frameworks, styleguides, atoms & molecules.
                </p>

                <p>I also like MVP's and done-better-then-perfect so the portfolio here is a work in progress.
                    If you want to see my older works (circa 2015) check <a href="http://cargocollective.com/konstdmitriev">my&#160;cargo&#160;portfolio</a>.
                I also dribbble sometimes so check some of my shots <a href="https://dribbble.com/hedonistjugend">on Dribbble</a>.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of Crypto Frenzy, I joined a digital agency that was providing blockchain startups with UX, design, naming and so on. Unfortunately biggest part of it was under an NDA. Though then we transformed into a product company making Tokenville. Storytelling on the blockchain.

                <p>
                    I am Product Designer leading team of 2. And also somehow a bit of product manager combining all efforts of our small team.

                <p>Content Owners have a lot of stuff: books, videos, audios, software & access to their secret services.
                    So they want these things  to be easy and quick to access by users in exchange of user's money.
                    Definitely Content Owners are afraid that users will share content with each other without permission.
                    Or even pirates will steal their content.
                    So here we come: we are Aggregion and we protect Content Owner's stuff and help to distribute it to end users.
                    Oh, and also there are Resellers, who want to sell various Content Owners' content to broader audience.
                    And of course there are libraries and universities too,
                    who are willing to share their books, videos etc, but need it to be returnable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are quite good at our job so our clients and partners
                    include Microsoft, Samsung, Intel, Disney and many more small & big publishers and content owners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am Lead Product Designer (basically because I'm the only product designer) responsible for all tasks involving design: main web app, tablet apps, video players, content e-mails and so on.
